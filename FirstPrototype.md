# First Prototype: Distorted Realities in Surveillance
## Meera, Hind & Rama
For our capstone project, we’ve been exploring how to make the viewer feel observed and manipulated, blending elements of surveillance and media distortion. Today, we worked on the first prototype of our exhibition, which will serve as the foundation for the final design. The prototype incorporates both technical elements and the physical layout of the exhibit, inspired by one of our artistic references (The Weather Project).
One major component we experimented with for our first prototype is a webcam display that distorts real-time video feed using recursion effects and background removal, inspired by Cullerton's video delay techniques. This will act as a subtle but eerie background element within the exhibition, immersing visitors into a manipulated, unsettling experience from the moment they enter. Previously, we wanted to make this a more prominent aspect of our exhibition but after playing around and testing with it, we feel it may work better as a piece to the puzzle rather than the main element.
In addition to the video playback, we created a rough 3D model of the exhibition space. The layout is L-shaped, with a dimly lit entrance hallway filled with sensors. These sensors will trigger an interaction as soon as a visitor enters, playing with the theme of surveillance by immediately capturing and manipulating their movements. Toward the end of the L-shaped path lies the final presentation room, which we’re still developing in terms of decoration and sensor technology. We have a few sketches on what this may look like but essentially, we want this room to display the outcome of the visitor's interactions, fully immersing them in the consequences of being observed. We have a few ideas about what we can or can not do that we will explore in the coming weekend.
This prototype helps us visualize the flow of the exhibit and how we want visitors to move and feel as they progress through it. While we’re still working out some details, we hope this prototype will provide clarity for us as well as valuable feedback from our advisors and peers. For now, it’s about capturing that ‘it’ factor—where surveillance doesn’t just feel like observation but active manipulation of the visitor’s experience.
This documentation includes sketches, a 3D model of the exhibit, and a video showing the distorted webcam playback.
We’re excited to see how these initial ideas evolve and push us closer to our final vision.
